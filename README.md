# 🧩 Karan Pandey's DSA - LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **Daily LeetCode Challenge Repository**!  
This repository tracks all my **DSA problem-solving progress** as I commit my solutions daily. It serves both as a **personal log** and a **showcase of consistency, learning, and improvement** in algorithms and data structures.

## 💡 Learning & Notes

For every problem I solve, I maintain notes on:  

- **Approach:** Brute force & optimized  
- **Time & Space Complexity**  
- **Edge cases & tricky inputs**  
- **Alternate solutions**  

This helps reinforce concepts and improves **problem-solving speed and accuracy**.

## 🚀 Future Goals

1. Complete **all LeetCode Easy & Medium problems** in the next 6 months.  
2. Solve at least **one Hard problem per week**.  
3. Build a **DSA problem-solving guide** for beginners.  
4. Contribute to **open-source algorithm repositories**.
